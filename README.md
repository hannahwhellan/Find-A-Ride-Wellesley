# Find-A-Ride-Wellesley
Login with Facebook and then go to a form to fill out when you are going to be leaving from Wellesley, where
you are going, and how many seats there are left in whatever car you are taking (including ride share apps).
I am hoping to be able to connect a Facebook messenger button to each ride so that each person is able to 
contact another for rides.
